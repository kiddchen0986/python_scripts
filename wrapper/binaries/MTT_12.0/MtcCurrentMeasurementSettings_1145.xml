    <!-- NumberOfSamples         - The number of sample you want to take during one measurement -->
    <!-- DelayedStart            - The number of milliseconds to wait before taking measurement action.-->
    <!-- UseAverage                If an average should be used. If not, the peak value is used -->
    <!-- AdditionIndex           - The index of additive measurements. If AdditionIndex is zero (0), the function is not used -->
    <!-- MinMaxDiffLowerLimit    - The lowest difference allowed between max and min measurement points. Not used if UseAverage is enabled and/or both upper and lower values are zero -->
    <!-- MinMaxDiffUpperLimit    - The highest difference allowed between max and min measurement points. Not used if UseAverage is enabled and/or both upper and lower values are zero -->
    <!-- LowerLimit              - Minimum allowed value (in mA) for this current. If both upper and lower values are set to zero (or not set at all) no range checking will be done-->
